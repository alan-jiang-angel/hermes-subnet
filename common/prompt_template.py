You are given the following document as background context:
{entity_schema}
Your task:
1. Carefully read and understand the schema, including types, queries, mutations, and relationships.
2. Generate ONE natural question that a user might ask based on this file.
3. The question must be related to a numerical value (e.g., quantity, percentage, date, amount, measurement) that appears in the file.
4. The question must explicitly relate to "indexer".
5. Output only the question, nothing else.
6. Do not include explanations, answers, or more than one question.

Now generate the question:

You are a question generator for database schema analysis.

Background Context:
{entity_schema}

Available Addresses:
- Indexers: 0xe60554D90AF0e84A9C3d1A8643e41e49403945a6, 0xF64476a9A06ABC89da3CE502c6E09b22B676C14E
- Consumer: 0x31E99bdA5939bA2e7528707507b017f43b67F89B

Available Era: 0x30, 0x40, 0x45, 0x48 (hexadecimal)

Task: Generate ONE natural question about numerical data from the schema above.

Definitions:
- "Numerical value" means a single count, sum, average, percentage, or other numeric metric.
- Each question must involve exactly ONE metric.
- If the output would be a list, show only the first 3 results.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT - MUST AVOID REPETITION:
{recent_questions}

Requirements:
1. Ask about a specific numerical value, metric, or calculation
2. Ensure the question is answerable using the provided schema
3. Focus on indexer/consumer operations or performance
4. Use natural, conversational language
5. You may reference the specific addresses above if relevant
6. The question must specify a single era from the available list: 0x40, 0x48, 0x49, 0x50, 0x51
7. If the answer would be a list, limit results to the first 3 items
8. Ask for ONLY ONE metric or value - do not use "and" or "or" to combine multiple questions
9. Each question must focus on a single data point or calculation
10. Randomly vary between these three main topic categories with equal probability:
    - Indexer rewards (total rewards, reward distribution, etc.)
    - APY (Annual Percentage Yield calculations, rates, etc.) 
    - Stake (staking amounts, stake distribution, etc.)
11. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT generate questions that are similar to the ones listed above in CRITICAL CONSTRAINT section


Question Examples:
- "How many blocks did indexer 0xe60554D90AF0e84A9C3d1A8643e41e49403945a6 process in era 0x48?"
- "What is the total gas consumed by all indexers in era 0x49?"
- "How many queries did the consumer submit during era 0x50, showing only the first 3 results?"
- "What percentage of indexing operations completed successfully in era 0x51?"
- "Show me the top 3 highest transaction counts per block in era 0x40"


Output: [Question only, no explanations]
